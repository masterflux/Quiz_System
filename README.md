# Quiz System  

## Overview  
This project is part of the **CSC8404 Advanced Programming in Java** coursework. It implements a **Quiz System** designed to assess students by providing structured quizzes, tracking performance, and generating insightful statistics.  

The system follows **object-oriented design principles**, including interface-based hierarchies, late binding, immutability, collections, and unit testing. The goal is to ensure a modular, extensible, and maintainable approach to quiz management.  

## Features  
âœ… **Quiz Management** â€“ Generates both **regular** and **revision** quizzes.  
âœ… **Student Tracking** â€“ Monitors quiz attempts, scores, and overall performance.  
âœ… **Flexible Question Types** â€“ Supports **multiple-choice** and **free-response** questions.  
âœ… **Scoring System** â€“ Automatically determines **pass/fail** results based on quiz scores.  
âœ… **Performance Insights** â€“ Generates statistics to help analyze student progress.  
âœ… **Unit Testing** â€“ Ensures system reliability using **JUnit**.  

## System Design  

### ðŸ”¹ Core Components  

#### **Question Interface & Implementations**  
- `Question` â€“ Base interface for quiz questions.  
- `FreeResponseQuestion` â€“ Represents open-ended questions.  
- `MultipleChoiceQuestion` â€“ Handles multiple-choice questions.
- `QuestionFactory` â€“ Differentiate between MCQ and Free Response Question.
- `QuestionPool` - Contains random pre-defined pool of Questions.

#### **Quiz System**  
- `QuizManager` â€“ Handles quiz creation logic, processes answers, calculates scores, tracks progress and handles quizes (Regular and Revision Quiz). 

#### **Student & Statistics**  
- `Student` â€“ Maintains student details and quiz history.  
- `StudentStatistics` â€“ Tracks and analyzes student performance metrics.
